GFX is a small game programming library for the great MSX computer :)

>> Site: [ http://jannone.org/gfxlib/ ]

Currently it is a work-in-progress (currently targeted at MSX 1.x series)

I decided to release this unfinished code anyway because:
	* it works.  well, the examples DO work ya know :)
	* it might be useful to someone else (writing code, learning, ...)
	* my lack of time isn't helping to move forward

SO... give it a try, look at the cool examples, send patches :)

Check the Changelog to see some of the most recent features.

Hope you enjoy it.  Happy coding!

Oh, and BTW, I wanna thank some of the MSXBR-L folks who gave me valuable 
information over time.  Thank you guys. :)

== FAQ

Q. How do I test the examples?

A. You'll need a disk with DOS.  Then just copy the .COM files
   inside, boot up your MSX and run the examples.


Q. How do I compile this stuff under Linux?

A. Install cpmemu (CP/M emulator) and Hitech-C compiler.


Q. And then what?

A. Grab some scripts to make your life easier. I am using those
   nice ones in the Makefile:

	http://uzix.sourceforge.net/common/htc_linux/htc
	http://uzix.sourceforge.net/common/htc_linux/htlibr

   Credits are into the scripts (thanks) :)


Q. Is there any documentation?

A. Yes! I figured it would be better to write some docs for more 
   people to get involved, so documentation is now available at
   the site.


Q. No more answers?

A. No more questions? :)
