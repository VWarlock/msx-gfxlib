* Current status of the SDCC port

- OK :: basic graphic functions and sprites
- OK :: joystick support
- OK :: PSG functions
- OK :: line drawing functions
- OK :: surface_t and polygon filling
- OK :: 3D functions
- BROKEN :: ~ex8.c~ (doesn't compile due to lack of I/O file
            primitives in SDCC)

* Where are the precompiled examples?
The compiled .ROM files are in subdirectory sdcc/rom_examples. I
compiled them with SDCC 3.4.2.

* Compiling the examples with SDCC
** Prerequisites
You need to have installed SDCC and to have set the environment
variable ~SDCC_HOME~. You also need some Unix utilities (from most
important to least important): ~make~, ~dd~, ~rm~, ~sed~,
~gawk~. Linux users always have them installed, but if you work on
Windows find them with Google (search for "UnxUtils").

** How to compile using Makefile.sdcc
Go to the same directory of ~Makefile.sdcc~ and type the following
commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # let's start from a clean directory
  #
  make -f Makefile.sdcc clean

  # let's prepare custom heap for examples
  # that need big space for malloc; 9000 bytes
  # proved sufficient for all included examples
  #
  make -f Makefile.sdcc heap.rel

  # these examples are known to work with SDCC
  #
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex1
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex2
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex3
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex4
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex6
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex7
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex9
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex12

  # these examples are known to work with SDCC
  # but need enlarged heap for big mallocs
  #
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex5 OTHERLIBS=heap.rel
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex10 OTHERLIBS=heap.rel

  # ex11.c works with SDCC but needs enlarged heap and 3d.rel
  #
  make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex11 GFXLIB="gfx.rel line.rel 3d.rel" OTHERLIBS=heap.rel

  # can't test this on SDCC yet: it needs .COM format
  # and file functions (fread, fseek etc.)
  #
  # make -f Makefile.sdcc PROJECT=ex8

#+END_SRC

* Roadmap of improvements
** Bug corrections
  - add file I/O functions to ~ex8.c~ and compile it
  - don't assume BIOS is always in slot zero, use EXPTBL value instead
  
** Library enhancements
  - add support for MSX pad primitives
  - add support for mouse?
  - split ~gfx.c~ in several files (so linker can include just the
    modules that are actually invoked): ~gfx.c~, ~psg.c~, ~joystick.c~...
  - pack the GFXlib in a library archive (~gfx.a~) using the SDCC ~ar~ utility
